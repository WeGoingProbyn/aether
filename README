# Aether

Aether is a Rust-based experimental project for developing and validating
numerical solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs), with real-time
visualization using the Bevy game engine.

The project emphasizes a **modular, engine-agnostic architecture**, separating
core mathematical and numerical logic from application and rendering concerns.

---

## Overview

Aether is designed as a foundation for experimenting with continuum mechanics,
transport equations, and eventually fluid dynamics across different coordinate
systems.

The codebase is structured to:

- Keep numerical solvers independent of any game engine
- Enable rapid validation through real-time visualization
- Scale toward more complex geometries and coordinate systems
- Serve as a potential basis for interactive simulations or games

At present, the project focuses on solving and visualizing simple PDEs (such as
temperature advection–diffusion) on structured Cartesian grids.

The `continuum` module contains **no Bevy dependencies** and can be reused in
headless simulations or other frontends.

The `app` module integrates the solvers into a Bevy application for visualization
and interaction.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable recommended)
- Cargo (installed with Rust)
- A GPU capable of running Bevy’s rendering backend

---

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WeGoingProbyn/aether.git
cd aether
```

# Building
Build using cargo's compiler:

```bash
cargo b --release
```

# Running

Run the application layer to visualize the simulation:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

When running, a window will open displaying the current scalar field.

# Testing

Run the test suite (primarily targeting the continuum module):

```bash
cargo test
```

These tests focus on basic correctness and numerical sanity checks.

# Project Modules
## app

The application layer built on top of Bevy:

- Owning simulation state as Bevy resources

- Scheduling solver time steps

- Uploading field data to GPU textures

- Rendering scalar fields for visual inspection

- Handling input and application lifecycle

This layer is intentionally thin and delegates all numerical work to continuum.

## continuum

The core numerical and mathematical library:

- Grid definitions and indexing

- Field storage and access

- Coordinate system abstractions

- PDE discretization and time-stepping logic

- Numerical correctness tests

This module is engine-agnostic and does not depend on Bevy or any rendering code.
